Current schedule starts well within wagie hours for pretty much the entirety of North America. It's movie4chan not wagie4chan."

"2021/05/07 2:11:17 am CET","","70s Kino Night, Western Animation Night, Asylum Night (Transmorphers, Sharknado, etc), XTREEM Sports Movie Night","I would like to run a 'Black Tanktop' night where we watch movies by famous film flop directors Tommy Wiseau (The Room), Neil Breen (Twisted Pair) and Deuandra T. Brown (Diamond Cobra vs the White Fox), not necessarily in that order. Interspersed would be interviews and other silly videos of the directors (mostly tommy wiseau and neil breen) that take a peek behind the insanity curtain.

The term 'Black Tanktop' is pulled from Redlettermedia where they point out that all of these narcissistic movie directors that star in their own films all at some point wear black tanktops/wifebeaters in the movie for whatever reason."
