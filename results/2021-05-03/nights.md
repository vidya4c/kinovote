# May Curated Themes
## Australiana
I'd probably curate a list of the best Australian movies they most of m4c probably haven't seen before.

## Black Tanktop
I would like to run a 'Black Tanktop' night where we watch movies by famous film flop directors Tommy Wiseau ([The Room](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368226/)), Neil Breen ([Twisted Pair](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8196068/)) and Deuandra T. Brown ([Diamond Cobra vs the White Fox](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3178320/)), not necessarily in that order. Interspersed would be interviews and other silly videos of the directors (mostly tommy wiseau and neil breen) that take a peek behind the insanity curtain.

The term 'Black Tanktop' is pulled from Redlettermedia where they point out that all of these narcissistic movie directors that star in their own films all at some point wear black tanktops/wifebeaters in the movie for whatever reason.

## Fate is Unavoidable
Fate is unavoidable. [Carmina Burana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gj-tBVq61as) and [Final Flesh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlcrsAZUC-E)

## Shogun
[Shogun](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080274/) the tv minisereies.

## The 7 Faces of the Ice Air-pirates
[The Ice Pirates](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087451/), [7 Faces of Dr Lao](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057812/), [Airplane](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080339/).

## Classic Extreme Sports Docs Night
Classic extreme sports docs night. Potentially: [On Any Sunday](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067527/) or [On Any Sunday 2](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0158832/), [The Endless Summer](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060371/), [The Endless Summer II](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109729/), [A Sunday in Hell](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0193171/), [Any Snow Any Mountain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2f62wOXXYY), [Everest The Hard Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYB9geb-YYQ), and potentially others. I am shooting for a good variety of sports with potentially 2 short films with 2 long films.
